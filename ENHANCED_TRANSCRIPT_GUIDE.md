# Enhanced Transcript Editing Guide

## 🎯 New Simplified Workflow

The transcript editing has been completely redesigned for an easier "paste and annotate" workflow.

### Primary Method: Rich Text Transcript (📝 Transcript - Paste & Annotate)

This is now the **recommended method** for all transcript editing.

#### How it works:

1. **Paste your raw transcript** directly into the rich text editor
2. **Format speaker names** by selecting text and clicking "Speaker" (H4) in the toolbar
3. **Add timestamps** by selecting text and using the timestamp annotation
4. **Add speaker references** by selecting text and using the speaker annotation

#### Example Workflow:

```
1. Copy this raw transcript:
   Welcome to the show. Today we have John Smith, a tech entrepreneur.
   Thanks for having me! I'm excited to discuss our new startup.

2. Paste it into the editor

3. Format it:
   [Select "Welcome to the show"] → Click "Speaker" style → Type "Host"
   [Select "Thanks for having me!"] → Click "Speaker" style → Type "Guest"

4. Add timestamps:
   [Select "Welcome to the show"] → Click timestamp annotation → Enter "0:15"
   [Select "Thanks for having me!"] → Click timestamp annotation → Enter "0:45"

5. Add speaker references:
   [Select "Guest"] → Click speaker annotation → Choose "Guest" → Select "John Smith"
```

### Features:

#### 🎯 **Annotations Available:**

- **Timestamps**: Format `MM:SS` or `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., `1:23` or `1:23:45`)

  - Mark as "Key Moment" for highlights
  - Displays as blue badges: `[1:23] ★`

- **Speaker References**: Link text to specific people
  - Choose from Host, Guest, or Other
  - References actual Guest/Host documents
  - Displays as green badges: `@ [text]`

#### 🎨 **Styles Available:**

- **Normal**: Regular transcript text
- **Speaker**: Use for speaker names (shows as H4 headers)

#### ✨ **Visual Feedback:**

- Timestamps show as blue badges with time
- Speaker references show as green badges
- Key moments get star indicators ★

### Advanced Method: Transcript Segments

The structured segment approach is still available but hidden when using the rich text method. Use this only for:

- Very complex transcripts with detailed metadata
- Integration with external transcript systems
- When you need individual segment-level controls

## 🔄 Migration

- **Existing transcripts** continue to work normally
- **New transcripts** should use the rich text method
- **Mixed usage** is supported (each episode can use either method)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start simple**: Paste raw text first, then add formatting
2. **Use speaker style**: Make speaker names stand out with H4 formatting
3. **Add timestamps last**: Focus on content first, timing annotations second
4. **Key moments**: Mark important timestamps for episode highlights
5. **Speaker references**: Link speakers to guest/host documents for consistency

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **Faster editing**: Copy-paste workflow instead of individual segments
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: See timestamps and speakers as you work
- ✅ **Flexible formatting**: Rich text with structure when needed
- ✅ **Better UX**: Intuitive toolbar instead of forms
- ✅ **Reference linking**: Connect speakers to actual guest/host data
