Social Media Links (bottom of page):
Lastly the social links need to be associated appropriately (Aileen will provide you with the appropriate links), but I would like to send them to:
- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter
- Tik Tok
- Buzzsprout (for a selection of audio channels) - we probably just need an icon that indicates "audio"

(NOTES FOR ME)
