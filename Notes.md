# Fixes

- Episodes out of order : Season 4.

# Improvements

TINY MINI YOUTUBE PLAYER YOU STARTED.

Don't rely on UUIDs or episodeNumber field as it can be incorrectly applied from the title of the youtube video (two videos with the same episode number caused BIG bug lol)
Redirect existing UUIDS to slug based on title, use title as pathname slug
