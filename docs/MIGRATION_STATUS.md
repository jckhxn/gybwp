## 🎯 Current Status: READY FOR TESTING!

**All code updates are complete!** 🎉

### 🧪 Testing Phase

Now test these key areas to verify the migration worked:

1. **Guest detail pages** - Check if they load correctly with person data
2. **Episode pages** - Verify guest names and links work
3. **Search functionality** - Test guest/host search
4. **Transcript display** - Test speaker resolution

### Example URLs to Test:

- Guest detail page: `/person/[guest-slug]`
- Episode with guests: `/episode/[episode-slug]`
- Search for guest names

### If Testing Goes Well:

**Final cleanup** - Remove old schema files:

```bash
rm sanity/schemas/documents/guest.ts
rm sanity/schemas/documents/host.ts
```

## 🎉 Migration Status: 100% Complete (Pending Testing)

All data migration and code updates are finished! The guest/host to person schema migration is ready for production use.
